# DIY Product Hunt

## Brief Introduction

DIY Product Hunt is a website for creators to share their DIY creations. DIY Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day.
It's a place for DIY enthusiasts to share and geek out about their latest creations and foster a client base. As well as a place for collectors to find cool products that may not be avalable on the traditional marketplace.
<!-- Add a cover/banner image for your README. **Why?** Because it easily **grabs people's attention** and it **looks cool**(*duh!obviously!*).
The best dimensions for the banner is **1280x650px**. You could also use this for social preview of your repo. -->

# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->
